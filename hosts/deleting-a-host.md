# Deleting a Host

It is not possible to remove a Host from your RevSplit account. This is because we need to keep a record of your earnings from each Host. However, you can disable a Host so that it no longer appears in your dashboard. To do this, click on the **Hosts** tab on the left-hand side of the screen, then click on the **Disable** button next to the Host you want to disable.

## Unlinking a Host

In case we have a direct integration (for example YouTube Content Owners), you can unlink a Host from your RevSplit account. This will remove the Host from your dashboard and revoke RevSplit's access to your account. Please note that this will not delete your account with the Host. 

To unlink a Host, click on the **Hosts** tab on the left-hand side of the screen, then click on the **Unlink** button next to the Host you want to unlink.
