# Hosts within RevSplit

In the world of content creation, distributing your work through various platforms, or "Hosts," is crucial to reaching a wider audience and generating revenue. With RevSplit, you can seamlessly integrate these Hosts into your account to efficiently manage your earnings. 

## What is a Host?

A Host is a content provider, distributor or platform where you showcase and distribute your digital content, such as videos, music, podcasts, or ebooks. Hosts offer monetization options, allowing you to earn revenue from your creations. Some examples of Hosts include YouTube, Facebook, and Spotify. It can also be a distributor that publishes your content on half of your behalf. 

## Why should I add a Host?

Adding a Host to your RevSplit account allows you to manage your earnings from all of your Hosts in one place. You can also use RevSplit to track your earnings and compare them across Hosts.
This streamlines your payment management. Instead of having to manage multiple accounts and payment methods, you can manage all of your earnings from one place.
