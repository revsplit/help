# Clients

In the context of RevSplit, a "Client" is a content creator who produces a diverse range of digital content, such as videos, music, podcasts, and more. These creative individuals are at the core of the content creation process and form the backbone of the content ecosystem.

A Client can be an individual or a company. For example, a Client can be a YouTuber, a record label, or a podcast network.

A Client can hold rights of ownership or royalty rights to the content they produce. You register these rights (contracts) under the Client's account in RevSplit. This allows you to track the Client's earnings and distribute them to the relevant parties.
