# Adding a Client

Adding a Client allows you to manage their ownership and to pay them their earnings.

## How to add a Client

1. Log in to your RevSplit account.
2. Click on the **Clients** tab on the left-hand side of the screen.
3. Click on the **Add Client** button.
4. Choose whether you want to add an individual or a company.
5. Fill in the required information.

After you add a Client, you can add ownership to their account. Ownership (or contracts) represent the rights of ownership or royalty rights that the Client holds to the content they produce. You can do this on the **Ownership** tab of the Client's account.
